I know that folks swear by Firefox, but I don’t - and typically find myself swearing at Firefox.

Part of my Safari preference is that I also have a teeny bit of a crush for WebKit, the engine that powers Safari with its CSS animations and long-supported (much clichéd) rounded corners.\nIn a quick trawl through my Applications folder last weekend, I happened to come across a rather old Chrome OS X Developer Preview that I’d downloaded and promptly forgotten about. Purely out of curiosity I ran it, made sure it was up to date, and started using it.\nI haven’t stopped since.\nSome Observations It’s fast. Lightning fast - I thought Safari was snappy (and compared to Firefox and Camino, it is) but Chrome is screaming in comparison. Top tabs - I was probably in the minority to mourn their demise in the final Safari 4 release, but it’s great to have them back. The behaviour of Chrome’s “Open in New Tab” option is also fantastic: when opening links in a new tab, the tab opens alongside the existing tab you’re working in. Safari adds tabs after the right-most tab, whereas Chrome’s option groups the links together, easily allowing you to return to your original tab. It’s super-stable - it’s not crashed or hung on me in a week - and it’s still not entered Beta. Take that, Safari. The combined search / address field - I find myself still hitting Tab, expecting it to focus a search box, but another few days use should cure that. It’s WebKit - enough said. The bit where I whinge about some minor issue Whilst Chrome looks and feels like a Mac application, there’s one striking annoyance that irritates me: the behaviour when you click on a Folder in the Bookmark bar. In any other browser, it behaves as an OS X menu should. That is, no matter where you click the item, the menu should appear in a fixed location, below the menu item in question. OS X’s default contextual menus appear directly below and to the right of the area you click.\nAs it stands right now - and shown in the above comparison - Chrome’s bookmark folders behave like a contextual menu (despite also having their own contextual menus), and it’s driving me a little crazy. Yes, Chrome remains in Pre-Beta - and these things can change - but it’s details like this that make or break whether an application feels like a Mac application. Never mind if an app’s got aqua buttons, a sexy HUD or any other aesthetic beauty. It’s all about how an application behaves.\nIf you’re wanting to give Chrome a go, it’s available from the Chrome Developer Channel. It’s still pre-beta, however in my experience it seems to be more relating to its feature-incomplete state than anything else. I’ve been using the Chrome Preview non-stop for the past week, and you’ll have to pry it out of my cold, dead hands.\n","wordCount":"549","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2009-12-05T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2009-12-05T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Me"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://darkestnotes.org/posts/a-week-with-google-chrome/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Darkest Notes","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://darkestnotes.org/assets/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://darkestnotes.org/ accesskey=h title="Darkest Notes (Alt + H)"><img src=https://darkestnotes.org/assets/favicon.ico alt aria-label=logo height=35>Darkest Notes</a><div class=logo-switches></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://darkestnotes.org/about/ title="About Me"><span>About Me</span></a></li><li><a href=https://darkestnotes.org/posts/ title=Blog><span>Blog</span></a></li><li><a href=https://darkestnotes.org/archives/ title=Archive><span>Archive</span></a></li><li><a href=https://darkestnotes.org/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://darkestnotes.org/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class=post-title>A week with Google Chrome</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2009-12-05 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>5 December 2009</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;549 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Me</div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=http://nikf.org/post/270793613/a-week-with-google-chrome>nikf</a>:</p><blockquote><p>In the five years that I’ve used a Mac, I’ve had two browsers of choice: Camino, and then with Safari 3’s arrival Safari.
